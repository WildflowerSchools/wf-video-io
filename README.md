# video_io

Tools for accessing Wildflower video data

## Task list
* Update dependencies
* Change name of client argument from `minimal_honeycomb_client` to `client` (to be consistent with other libraries)
* Consider changing API so user specifies beginning and end of time interval rather than minimum start time and maximum start time
* Update docstrings for main user-facing classes, methods, and functions
* Add ability to request concatenation of videos
